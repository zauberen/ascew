# A Simple Console Emulator for Windows

Maybe not quite the emulator you're thinking of (because it runs in the basic console) however, it adds functionality, along with customization to an otherwise normal console.

Great for using the cmd utility when the network admin has restricted access to it. The editor also comes with a config file system where you can run apps with a set alias configured within, it's best used for simplifying windows commands (eg dir to ls or cls to clear).

# To Install

Get the files:
For nightly builds: master/bin

For stable builds: The release tab

Then copy ascew.exe and (optionally) the config file into the directory of your choice

## Tested in:
Unrestricted: Windows 10, 7 (both passing)

Restricted: Windows 7 (passing)
